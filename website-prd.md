# Product Requirements Document: The Ivy Ascent Platform

## 1\. Introduction & Vision

  * **Product Name:** The Ivy Ascent Platform

We will empower high school students and their families with a strategic four-year roadmap, expert insights, and tiered resources to build a compelling and authentic application, maximizing their chances of admission to Ivy League and other top-tier universities.

## 2\. Target Audience

This platform is designed for two primary user personas:

  * **The Ambitious Student (Ages 13-18):** Highly motivated and goal-oriented, seeking a clear, actionable plan to navigate high school. They are tech-savvy and desire personalized tools and content that align with their specific academic and extracurricular interests.

## 3\. Core Philosophy & Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Our core philosophy is that a successful Ivy League application is not about checking boxes, but about building an authentic, compelling, and "spiky" narrative over four years.[1, 2] Our USP is to **democratize elite admissions strategy** by combining the structured, long-term planning of a four-year roadmap with the targeted, narrative-driven insights of top-tier concierge coaches. We provide a single, trusted platform that grows with the student, offering everything from foundational knowledge to premium, personalized coaching.
